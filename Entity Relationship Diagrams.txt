Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- ERD is a visual representation of the database structure.
- Usally created after the normalization process.

Advantages of using ERD
- Helps identify places where the proposed structure may not work.
- Allows the team to see the database's structure.
- Gives you a condensed representation of the database's structure.
    - Helps you write SQL statements more quickly.

ERD Components
- Tables: represented by a rectangle, normally divided into three sections horizontally
    - Names of the table, primary key field(s) and remaining fields
- Metadata of fields: tells us which fields are nullable and what data type each field will use.
- Keys:  indicate the primary and foreign keys 
     - add PK and FK to the left of the appropriate field names in the table
- Relationships: use an arrow that points FROM the one side of the relationship TO the many side of the relationship
    - Crow's foot marking: three small lines to indicate many relationship
    - Small vertical line: indicate that each record in table A must have at least one related record in table B

Many-to-Many Relationships
- To visualize many-to-many Relationships in ERD, it is split into two one-to-many relationships represented by three tables
    - two original tables and a bridge table
    - the primary key fields of the original tables are used to create the primary key of the bridge table
