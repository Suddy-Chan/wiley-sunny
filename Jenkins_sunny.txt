CI/CD
- set of practices in software engineering
- Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery/continuous deployment (CD)
- Continuous integration: Frequent merging of small changes into a main branch
- Continuous delivery: When teams produce software in short cycles with high speed and frequency so that reliable software can be released at any time, 
  and with a simple and repeatable deployment process when deciding to deploy
- Continuous deployment: When new software functionality is rolled out completely automatically

Jenkins
- automation server for the continuous integration (CI) cycle initially
- can cross the entire SDLC, including deployment
- can run almost anything except graphical services

Pipelines
- From development to production:
  Code commit, Build, Test, Release, Deploy/Deliver
- Jenkins uses Groovy language to code pipelines
- Requires Pipeline plugin and dependencies to be installed
- Blue Ocean plugin can be used for autodetection in a Git repository
