rm -r Algo1

Make a directory named Payment1
mkdir Payment1

Within Payment1, make three directories named logs, configuration, and scripts
cd Payment1
mkdir logs configuration scripts

Within scripts, create an empty file named start.sh
cd scripts
touch start.sh

Within configuration, create an empty file named instance.properties
cd ..
cd configuration
touch instance.properties

Give everyone permission to read the instance.properties file, but assign write and execute permissons only to yourself
chmod 744 instance.properties

Set permissions on the file start.sh so that everyone can execute and so that the group and owner can read and write
cd ..
cd scripts
chmod ug=rwx,o=x start.sh

Direct the output of man cat into a file in your home directory named cat.output
echo `man cat`>cat.output

chmod g=rwx,u=r,o=r cat.output

Go back to your home directory
cd ~

Prove your location
pwd

Remove the directory Payment1 along with all subdirectories
rm -r Payment1

Delete the cat.output file, but with a warning first to the user
rm cat.output

Create a directory named temp
mkdir temp

Set a variable named MYTEMP that references the new temp directory you just created

Now set the value of $MYTEMP to nothing
unset MYTEMP

Remove the temp directory that you created
rm -r temp
